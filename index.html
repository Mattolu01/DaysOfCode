    <p>
        I learnt about the "P" (paragraph) tag, the "H1 to H6" (heading) tags, and the "A" (anchor) tag.
    </p>
    <h1>This right here is written with "h1" tag</h1>
    <h2>This right here is written with "h2" tag</h2>
    <h3>This right here is written with "h3" tag</h3>
    <h4>This right here is written with "h4" tag</h4>
    <h5>This right here is written with "h5" tag</h5>
    <h6>This right here is written with "h6" tag</h6>
    <p>The "h1" tag has the largest and boldest font size, follow by the "h2", then "h3" and down to "h6" which is the smallest font size.</p>
    <p>The "p" tag is used to start a new paragraph</p>
    <p>
        <h3>The "a" tag is used to add links to text as seen below.</h3>
        <a href="X.com">X link</a>
        <a href="facebook.com">facebook link</a>
        <a href="google.com">google link</a>


        <p>Today, I will be talking about, 'Title", "Favicon", "Strong", "Order and Unorder list" "Break" tags.</p>

        The "title" tag is found in the "head" area of the HTML used to give name-title to a webpage which appears in the browser tab.
        The "Break" tag, represented as "<br>", is used to break between words or sentences to the next line.

    <p>Today, I'm writing about "Strong", "order list, unorder list & list", and "Break" tags.</p>

        The "title" tag is found in the "head" area of the HTML used to give name/title to a webpage which appears in the browser tab. "Favicon" is used to place image or icon beside the title in the browser tab. <br>
        Lameda is the title as seen on the browser tab above, and the favicon is the image beside it. <br><br>
        The "Break" tag, represented with "br", is used to break between words or sentences to the next line. <br>
        This statement on a new line is moved here with the "Break" tag above this line of code. <br><br>
        The "Strong" tag is used to make text bold like <strong>THIS.</strong> <br>
        <strong>This line is written with "Strong" tag</strong> <br>
        This line is written without the "Strong" tag <br><br>

        The "Ordered list" is used to create a list with numbers, represented as "ol".
        <ol>
            <li>Nursery</li>
            <li>Primary</li>
            <li>Secondary</li>
            <li>Tertiary</li>
        </ol>

        The "Unordered list" is used to create a list item with bullets, represented as "ol".

        <ul>
            <li>Nursery</li>
            <li>Primary</li>
            <li>Secondary</li>
            <li>Tertiary</li>
        </ul>
        The "list" tag is used to define each item in the list, represented as "li".
