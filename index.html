    <p>
        I learnt about the "P" (paragraph) tag, the "H1 to H6" (heading) tags, and the "A" (anchor) tag.
    </p>
    <h1>This right here is written with "h1" tag</h1>
    <h2>This right here is written with "h2" tag</h2>
    <h3>This right here is written with "h3" tag</h3>
    <h4>This right here is written with "h4" tag</h4>
    <h5>This right here is written with "h5" tag</h5>
    <h6>This right here is written with "h6" tag</h6>
    <p>The "h1" tag has the largest and boldest font size, follow by the "h2", then "h3" and down to "h6" which is the smallest font size.</p>
    <p>The "p" tag is used to start a new paragraph</p>
    <p>
        <h3>The "a" tag is used to add links to text as seen below.</h3>
        <a href="X.com">X link</a>
        <a href="facebook.com">facebook link</a>
        <a href="google.com">google link</a>


        <p>Today, I will be talking about, 'Title", "Favicon", "Strong", "Order and Unorder list" "Break" tags.</p>

        The "title" tag is found in the "head" area of the HTML used to give name-title to a webpage which appears in the browser tab. "Favicon" is used to place image or icon beside the title in the browswer tab.
        The "Break" tag, represented as "<br>", is used to break between words or sentences to the next line.
